# custom-facts

[![N|Solid](http://gokev.com/GoKEV200.png)](https://goKev.com)

This Ansible playbook will lay down custom facts to be read later in a `setup` fact collection
  - Default variables in the playbook itself
  - Additional vars.yml file to be imported at runtime, demonstrating a deeply nested YAML structure
  
> This set of files will serve as a starter template to add custom facts to a system *with* Ansible that will also be readable *by* Ansible
